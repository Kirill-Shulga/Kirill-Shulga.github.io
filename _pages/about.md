I am Kirill Shulga, a Postdoctoral researcher at Institute of Physics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. I am an experimental physicist, and my research interests include many-body physics, quantum coherent effects, metamaterial physics, and more recently the physics of Time.  I study condensed matter physics phenomena in synthetic quantum matter, such as superconducting qubits and photons in cavities.
