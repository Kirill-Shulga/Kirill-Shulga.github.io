I am Kirill Shulga, a Postdoctoral researcher at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Japan. I am an experimental physicist, and my research interests include many-body physics, quantum coherent effects, metamaterial physics, and more recently the physics of time.  I study condensed matter physics phenomena in synthetic quantum matter, such as superconducting qubits and electrons on Helium.
