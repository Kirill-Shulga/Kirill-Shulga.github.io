Sometimes I find very interesting files and treasures hidden by time and language barriers. One such treasure is before you. It is the article (or rather a series of three articles) by the Japanese theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Hideki Yukawa, which I found in the RIKEN Institute library (Wako campus) in printed form. As far as I can judge, you won't be able to find it anywhere else on the web except on my site. 

I have made recognition of the old printed text and I am putting the three-part file stitched together here. The text of this article was written in the old, pre-reform Japanese, and therefore, on request, I can provide its modernized version as well as my translations into English and Russian. I must warn you that I am not a native Japanese speaker and my translation may not be perfect.
